Today I have a little information to share with you about an awesome program that Keller Williams offers. **BOLD is an agent training program that helps you with managing time, money, mindset, and foundational skills. It’s an amazing learning experience.**

If you could take approximately seven to eight listings in the next seven weeks, would that be something that would interest you? I would think so. **By studying BOLD, you will learn how to manage your time, earn more money, create the amazing mindset you need in order to function in your business, and the foundational skills that will help you get there.**

This program has allowed some of our top agents to reach a level in their career that they thought they would never reach before.

If you think this is something that could benefit you or someone you know, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to sit down with you and tell you exactly how you will be able to take another seven to eight listings in the next seven to eight weeks. I look forward to hearing from you.
