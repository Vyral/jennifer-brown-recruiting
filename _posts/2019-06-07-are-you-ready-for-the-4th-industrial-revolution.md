There have been four industrial revolutions in our world in just the last few hundred years. **The first industrial revolution was when the steam engine was invented.** It allowed people to travel across large bodies of water much more quickly with steamboats and across countries with steam engine trains.&nbsp;

**The second industrial revolution was the introduction of mass production,** when factories opened and created a huge number of jobs.&nbsp;

**The third industrial revolution came with the advent of computers and cell phones,** which connected us both globally and instantly.

These days, we’re in a fourth industrial revolution and it’s going to impact us as agents in many ways. **This revolution is all about big data and artificial intelligence.** This is probably the biggest industrial revolution that we’ll see in our lifetime.

Artificial intelligence takes information, analyzes it, and processes it with the help of big data. For example, Amazon is taking all of their data so that when you go on your computer, you’ll notice ads on the right hand of your screen in regard to things you’ve recently looked at. Netflix is also using artificial intelligence to make recommendations based on your history.&nbsp;

In real estate, this revolution is making an impact. That’s why you need to work with a company that has big data. Keller Williams does, and **we’ve created a platform with artificial intelligence in order to give you and your clients the best experience ever.**

This is going to keep you at the center of your transaction, share what your clients want in a property based on what they’ve been looking at, and it’s going to be amazing. **If you’re not connected with a company that is able to utilize this big data and artificial intelligence, I’m afraid you’ll get left behind.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions for me, I’d love to sit down with you and talk about the fourth industrial revolution and the technology involved in it. Don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
