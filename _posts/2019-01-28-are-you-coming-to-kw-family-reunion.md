The Keller Williams Family Reunion is just around the corner, and you won’t want to miss out.

More than 15,000 agents from across the country will join together for this great event, where they’ll spend three days sharing ideas and learning about the latest tactics in our industry. The Family Reunion is designed to serve as an educational opportunity for agents. **There will be workshops about lead generation, discussions on best practices, breakout sessions, and much much more.**

The Keller Williams Family Reunion is unlike any other real estate event. It’s truly all about the agents.

To top it all off, keynote speaker and company co-founder Gary Keller will appear for a speech about the future of KW.

**The Family Reunion will take place from February 16 to February 19 in New Orleans, Louisiana,** and it’s not too late to secure your ticket. If you’re interested in going, please reach out to me.

But if you aren’t able to attend, don’t worry. I’ll be taking a ton of notes while I’m at this event and would be more than happy to share what I learned with you when I return.

**I’m so excited for this incredible learning opportunity, and I hope you’ll join me there.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
