There are 18 skills to acquire that will help you advance in your business, and today, I’ll cover the first nine for you:

1. **Asking good questions, not having unnecessary conversations.** This skill is super important for advancing your business because by asking questions, you find the rooted reason someone has for buying or selling a home.
2. **Listening to what clients say, not just thinking about what you’ll say next.**
3. **Knowing your scripts.** If you know your scripts, you can listen to what people say, instead of trying to think about your next response.
4. **Turning leads into appointments faster.** In order to advance, you’ll need to find out whether each lead you get wants to make their move quickly or if they’re planning to do it in the future. Our business is all about relationship-building, but in order to grow, you need to be able to determine how you can move a lead into an appointment. Skills 1-3 will also help you to do this.
5. **Measuring the depth of clients’ motivation.** Don’t spend all your time on a client who doesn’t really need to sell their home; really digging into a client’s motivation to act in the market will help you spend your time where it will be most profitable.&nbsp;
6. **Understand the market/neighborhood stats.** Have an intelligent conversation with your clients, and offer them information about what’s going on in the market so that they can make a decision about whether they need to move forward, or if they even can move forward.
7. **Defeating the distractions.** While you’re having conversations with your clients, you need to make sure that all the potential distractions around you are eliminated. Don’t let anything get in the way—make sure you know what the hurdles and challenges are beforehand, and have a solution ready. A lot of the obstacles you’ll come across will be the same across all transactions, so if you can identify those, it will really help your business move forward.
8. **Keeping the emotions between the lines.** On the highway, your job is to stay between the lane boundaries; in real estate, your job is to keep the emotions of the client (and your own) in check so that the transaction runs smoothly. You can do that with communication; make sure your clients are aware of everything that is happening and why.
9. **Making your clients feel important.** Everybody wants to feel important, and to you, your clients should be the most important thing at the moment. They’re dealing with one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives; make them feel as though you’re on their side. This is a critical skill to have in order to advance your real estate business.
