In my previous video, I shared the first nine of all the skills you will need to advance your business. Here are the rest of them:

1. **Increase effectiveness to get the most done in the least amount of time.** We’ve talked about time management in previous videos, and that’s because it’s very important.&nbsp;
2. **Use energy and enthusiasm in everything you do.** We can’t be at 100% all the time, but when you’re standing in front of a client or lead, you must have energy and enthusiasm.&nbsp;
3. **Make strong and professional presentations.** When it comes to business, your presentation must be strong, and you should have the necessary points to help your clients make good decisions. This means statistics, comps, your marketing plan, etc.&nbsp;
4. **Be direct without being afraid of the response.** One of the first things you should say to a seller should be something to the effect of, “My job is to get you the most money I can, and one of the things I may do is tell you things you don’t necessarily want to hear, but I’m doing this because we’re a team—we’re working together, so I need to be honest with you. Do I have your permission to be honest with you at all times?” After that, tell them that they’ll hear things sometimes that they don’t want to hear, but it’s in their best interest for you to tell them.
5. **Be relentless**. By this, I mean be relentless with your leads, time, pre-qualifying, presentations, and follow-up. If you aren’t relentless, you’ll have a hard time advancing your business.&nbsp;
6. **Use more self-discipline.** In other words, learn to do the things you don’t necessarily want to do, but that need to be done.&nbsp;
7. **Don’t be attached to the outcome.** Once you start making everything about the check that clears at the end of the transaction, it’s all downhill from there. When you focus on your clients and their needs, however, everything will fall into place. Everything you do should be in the best interests of the people you serve.&nbsp;
8. **Work on building business maturity.** Business maturity comes from failing forward—making mistakes, learning from them, and growing. Don’t ever feel like you can’t make a mistake. Mistakes are what help us grow, and the quicker you come back from your mistakes, the better off you’ll be.&nbsp;
