If you cracked into the real estate profession thinking you’d be able to become a top producer with little consideration for time management, you’re probably learning how off-base you were.&nbsp;

To help you improve your skills, here are a few pointers that will allow you to be better with your time.&nbsp;

1. **Know the days you’re going to work.** As you kick off each week, you should be mapping out when you’ll be working, what you’ll be doing, and the days you’ll be taking off. Time off is equally as important for your success because you’ll need downtime to recharge and get reinvigorated for the week to come.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
2. **Establish a strong schedule you’ll commit to.** Commit to this schedule at least 60% to 70% of the time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
3. **Follow the tenet, “The morning is for getting business, and the afternoon is for *doing* business.”** Getting business is defined as lead generation. Because your energy is at its highest in the morning, this is when you should be talking with people. The afternoon should be reserved for such activities as going on appointments.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
4. **Create several forms of accountability.** This can be an infinitely valuable tool for you. Whether it’s from a friend or even your kids, having someone hold you accountable on your goals can incentivize you to manage your time more effectively.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
5. **Make a habit of following your schedule.** Put another way, it all boils down to one word: repetition. Forming a schedule is integral to your business, so practicing a routine over and over will set you up for success. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
