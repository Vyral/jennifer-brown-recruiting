**KW Command is a platform that allows you to stay in control of your database, your business, and your future.** It allows you to do what you do best, which is having conversations and building relationships.&nbsp;

Why was Command built? **For one, Keller Williams wanted to offer this kind of technology to their agents and no additional cost so that they can build scalable and profitable businesses.**

Traditional real estate technology isn’t optimized for conversion. **Command prioritizes and identifies who you should be talking to in your database and when.** This ensures that you are never out of touch and always top of mind.

Finally, in traditional technology information around real estate is organized around zip codes and boundaries, but this is not how people live and search. They live in neighborhoods and communities. So does Command. **Information in Command is organized around the neighborhood so that you can provide your client with pertinent information.** It keeps you in a place where you can own your conversations.
