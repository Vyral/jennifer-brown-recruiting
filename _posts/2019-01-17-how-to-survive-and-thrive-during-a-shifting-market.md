When a shift occurs, a real estate agent’s view of the market may become fuzzy. It can become difficult to know what to do, what direction to take, and how to continue to thrive in your career.

So what’s the secret to continued success during these changing times in our market? Well, **when the market shifts, you need to shift with it.**

In the book “Shift,” author and real estate superstar Gary Keller explains that there are three types of agents who will emerge from a shift. We’ll be discussing each of these three archetypes today.

**The first type of agent is the pessimist.** This is the agent who can’t seem to focus on anything but the negative aspects of change. Ultimately, these agents will exit the industry.

**The second type of agent Keller describes is the optimist.** Though having a positive outlook is good, the optimist agent takes it too far. They assume that the market will remain as it was a year ago. In short, this agent is in denial. They don’t pay attention to what’s actually going on.

Neither of these two types of agents will do very well in a shifting market. The third type, though, is what agents should strive to be.

**The final archetype Keller describes is the realist.** Realist agents are the type who will accept that a shift is happening, then study and implement the proven models and systems that will help them work through it.

During the shifting market we saw a decade ago, Keller Williams was the No. 4 brokerage in the nation. By the time the shift was coming to an end, Keller Williams had shot up to No. 1.

This happened because agents who fit the third archetype, the realists, looked to our brokerage and knew that it would offer them a chance to succeed, no matter the state of the market.

Now that we’re on the cusp of another shift, **I’d like to offer you a free copy of “Shift” so that you can read more about the ideas I touched on today.**
